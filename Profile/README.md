[The Microbial Functional Genomics (MFG)](https://mfgenomics.com/site/) team is integrated into the Centre of Molecular and Environmental Biology (CBMA), a Research Unit hosted at the Department of Biology, School of Sciences at the University of Minho in Braga, Portugal. This team is coordinated by Pedro Santos, who is an Assistant Professor of the University of Minho since 2008.

We are interested in using integrative and systems biology to study bacteria and microbial communities. This team combines evolutionary biology, phenotyping, comparative genomics, metagenomics, bioinformatics and metadata analysis to develop work in three main research lines: cell factories; biomonitoring and biomedicine.
